        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>My name is Nat, and I built ChessEOS to prove my skills as a developer to acquire a job.  I don't have a CS degree; however, I believe that this is better.  I got into EOS around March and became so enfatuated with the concept that I tried to learn everything I could about it.  In doing so I weathered quite a bit of fud.  At a point, I decided I was going to learn C++ to further understand the protocal.  I took a course on Udemy and once I finished that, I had the developer bug.  I took another course to learn a stack then I got to building on this dapp.  I hope you enjoy it!</p>
