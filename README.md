Trying to build a simple EOS based chess game using [chess.js's](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) move generation/validation, piece placement/movement, and check/checkmate/stalemate detection as well as [chessboard.js's UI](http://chessboardjs.com/).

### Short-term goals: ###

* Integrate using demux blog example architecture (MongoDB, socket.io, Express).
* Integrate with Scatter
  * potential concern with frequency of needed approval to approve transaction, i.e., move a chess piece
* Style Home Page With Bootstrap
* Style About Page With Bootstrap
