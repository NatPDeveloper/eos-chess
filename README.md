# eos-chess
Trying to build a simple EOS based chess game

Short-term goals:

1. Integrate using demux blog example architecture (MongoDB, socket.io, Express).
2. Integrate with Scatter
  - potential concern with frequency of needed approval to approve transaction, i.e., move a chess piece
  - potential examples that differ:
    - EOS Authority's Space Invaders likely does not require constant pop-up approvals
3. Style Home Page With Bootstrap
4. Style About Page With Bootstrap
